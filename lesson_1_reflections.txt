As long as the number of changed items isn't too high,
it is much faster to find the bug, since it acts as a filter.

You can change things more liberately, since you can always go back quickly to the last work version.

With code, automatic saves will probably get you a lot of versions that don't even commit.
You can't add meaning to a commit, because you can't name it thus going back into your
commit history will take much more time to actually find what you're looking for.

Git is made for committing code and thus allowing to save multiple files in one commit makes sense.
Google Docs probably won't have any interactions between files, so this won't be necessary.

You can use git log to find a commit you're interested in based on the commit message
and then see what was changed by using git diff with that id and the id below it.

You can always go back, so of course you don't have to be afraid changing things.
