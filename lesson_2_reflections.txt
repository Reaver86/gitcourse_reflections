You need to initialize a repository if you want to commit them.

Thanks to the staging area you can bundle up files to one meaningful commit.

Add everything needed for a logical change to the staging area and then commit altogether.

Branches can be useful, if you want to make experimental changes without affecting the main program (master branch).

Diagrams help you see where you're working on right now, what other people have been doing on the master branch
in the mean time and what commits are included in certain branches.

Merging two branches combines them to essentially one branch, including changes made in one branch into the other branch.
